# Lotide

A mini clone of the [Lodash](https://lodash.com) library.

## Purpose

**_BEWARE:_ This library was published for learning purposes. It is _not_ intended for use in production-grade software.**

This project was created and published by me as part of my learnings at Lighthouse Labs. 

## Usage

**Install it:**

`npm install @sonder03/lotide`

**Require it:**

`const _ = require('@sonder03/lotide');`

**Call it:**

`const results = _.tail([1, 2, 3]) // => [2, 3]`

## Documentation

The following functions are currently implemented:

*
Make Lotide DirectoryOrganize code inside a git repository.
Implement Assert EqualWrite a function that takes in 2 values and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.
Improve Assert EqualWrite an updated Assert Equal Function that uses template literals.
Implement HeadWrite a function that takes in an array and returns the first element in the array.
Implement Tail Write a function that takes in an array and returns everything except the first element of the array.
Implement eqArraysWrite a function that takes in 2 arrays and returns true if the arrays are equal and false otherwise.
Implement assertArraysEqualWrite a function that takes in 2 arrays and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.
Implement withoutWrite a function that takes in a source array and an itemsToRemove arrays and returns only the items from the source array that are not in the itemsToRemove array
.Implement flattenWrite a function that takes in an array that contains elements including nested array of elements and returns a flattened version of the array.
Implement middleWrite a function that takes in an array and returns middle most element of the array.
Implement countOnly in LotideWrite a function that takes in a collection of items and returns a specific subset of those items.
Implement countLetters in LotideWrite a function that takes in a sentence and returns a count of each of the letters in the sentence.
Implement letterPositionsWrite a function that takes in a string and returns all indices of letter positions in the string.
Implement findKeyByValue in LotideWrite a function that takes in an object and a value and returns the first key that corresponds to that value. 
Implement eqObjectsWrite a function that takes in 2 objects and return true if they are equal and false otherwise.
Implement assertObjectsEqualWrite a function that takes in 2 objects and returns true if they are equal and false otherwise.
Implement MapWrite a function that takes in an array and a callback and returns a new array based on the results of the callback on each item in the array.
Implement takeUntilWrite a function that takes in an array and callback and returns a slice of the array based on the criteria specified in the callback.
Implement findKeyWrite a function that takes in an object and callback and returns the first key that meets the criteria specified in callback..
Lotide Refactor ExampleModularize assertEqual Function.
Refactor TailModularize tail function.
Refactor eqArraysModularise eqArrays function.
Refactor assertArraysEqualModularise assertArraysEqual function.
Refactor middleModularise middle function.
Incorporate Mocha and ChaiSet up correctly for testing with Mocha and Chai.
Refactor with Mocha and Chai IWrite tests for tail and middle functions using Mocha and Chai.
Exporting All Functions IICreate an index.js file that exports all the functions in Lotide as an object.
Implement Object ShorthandApply the new, shorter, property value shorthand syntax from ES6 to the main object being created and exported in the index.js file.
